This is the open-source core of [Pingplop][pingplop-site], a server and website uptime monitoring solution.
Pingplop is made in ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© and hosted on multiple regions at [Fly.io][fly-regions].You can find an interactive
demo of what the status page looks like [here][pingplop-demo].

## How does it work?

Site monitoring involves regularly checking a website's availability, performance, and functionality.
Pingplop send periodic requests to verify uptime, measure page load times, and detect errors or security
issues. Content monitoring ensures critical information is intact, and alerting systems notify administrators
of any breaches or anomalies. Historical data analysis enables trend identification and informed
decision-making to enhance overall website reliability.

The goal is to proactively address issues, preventing downtime and optimizing the user experience for visitors.
